 For our project, we will be using the following information pulled from the World Bank, to analyze data trends in the Caribbean and Latin America, and calculate the impact these factors have on economic growth within the region (measured as the increase in GDP).


# Dependent Variable:

**GDP per Capita Growth (Annual %)**
* Annual percentage growth rate of GDP per capita based on constant local currency. GDP per capita is the gross domestic product divided by the midyear population. We are using GDP at purchaser's prices, which is the sum of the gross value added by all resident producers in the economy, plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets, or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

## Independent Variables:

**Access to Electricity (% of Population)**
* This variable is measured as the percentage of the population with access to electricity. Electrification data are collected from industry, national surveys and international sources.

**Labor Force Participation Rate(% of Population - National Estimate)**
* Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period. For our dataset, we will be including males/females (15-24 years old). Each variation will have its own data, meaning that we have two different independent variables for Labor Force Participation Rate.

**Literacy Rate (% of Population)**
* Literacy rate is the percentage of people within our measured population who can both read and write, while understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life. For our dataset, we will be including youth males/females (15-24 years old), and adult males/females (15 years and older). Each variation will have its own data, meaning that we have four different independent variables for Literacy Rate.

**People Using at Least Basic Drinking Water Services (% of population)**
* This variable encompasses both people using basic water services, as well as those using safely managed water services.  Basic drinking water services is defined as drinking water from an improved source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip.  Improved water sources include piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water.

**Life Expectancy at Birth (Years)**
* Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live, if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life. For our dataset, we will be including males and females. Each variation will have its own data, meaning that we have two different independent variables for Life Expectancy at Birth.

**Net Migration (Persons)**
* This variable is the measure of the net total of migrants during the period; The number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants, including both citizens and noncitizens.

**School Enrollment, Primary (% Net)**
* Net enrollment rate is the ratio of children of official school age who are enrolled in school to the population of the corresponding official school age. Primary education provides children with basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills along with an elementary understanding of such subjects as history, geography, natural science, social science, art, and music.

## Models:

**Linear Regression**
* In supervised machine learning, linear regression finds the best linear fit between the dependent and independent variables. We will be using this to predict the future outcome of the GDP in the Caribbean and Latin America.

**Neural Networks (Supervised Learning)**
